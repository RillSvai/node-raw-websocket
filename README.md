# Overview

This project provides a basic implementation of a WebSocket server from scratch using Node.js. It's designed to handle WebSocket connections allowing clients to join specific rooms and broadcast messages within those rooms. This server handles the WebSocket handshake, interprets WebSocket frames (only text) and supports basic messaging and room management without relying on external WebSocket libraries.
